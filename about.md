I am an IT manager and cloud architect at Northwestern University. Proud to be an [AWS Education Champion](https://aws.amazon.com/education/education-champions/matthew-rich/) since 2023. I love connecting and empowering people through technology.

I am active in the Evanston, Illinois community and enjoy playing soccer and reading the biggest, gnarliest books I can get my hands on :)
