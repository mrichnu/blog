I am a cloud architect at Northwestern University, where I have also worked as a Python developer and research computing facilitator. I love automating things, teaching computational skills, and connecting people through technology.

When I'm not working I'm probably playing soccer, at a show, or reading the biggest, gnarliest book I can get my hands on.
