content_title: Hello!

### My name is Matthew Rich and I have been hacking on the web since 1998.

That year I bought a 66Mhz 486DX -- with a math coprocessor and 20 MB of RAM!
-- at a garage sale, installed Linux on it, and taught myself to make dynamic
websites with Perl.

Since then I have built more websites than I can count and have never stopped
loving the web. I work across a variety of languages (Python, C#, Javascript
primarily) and frameworks when building web applications that serve, satisfy,
and delight users.

My focus has grown to include DevOps automation tools and I help my users do
more with less by leveraging Ansible, Docker, and even custom build tooling.

When I'm not hacking or riding my bike I am busy raising two children, playing
and coaching soccer, windsurfing on Lake Michigan, and reading voraciously.
